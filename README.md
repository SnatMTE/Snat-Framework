# Snat's Framework
Everything here is complied together from websites I have created and re-use for many projects I do. Snat's Framework is a PHP framework that provides commonly used functions for web development. My future WordPress plugins will start to use this framework when required so I will be updating this with more and more random things that I can think off!

Installation

To use Snat's Framework, simply include the framework file in your PHP project:

require_once 'snat_framework.php';

You may, or may not, find this framework useful and I will be updating it quite a lot over the next few months. Expect it to be buggy, possibly insecure or outright not working. I am developing my own framework for the websites I create and each file will be updated as I go. 

So I will say this once.

# DO NOT USE ON A PRODUCTION SERVER #
