# Snat's Framework
Everything here is complied together from websites I have created and re-use for many projects I do. Snat's Framework is a PHP framework that provides commonly used functions for web development. My future WordPress plugins will start to use this framework when required so I will be updating this with more and more random things that I can think off!

Installation

To use Snat's Framework, simply include the framework file in your PHP project:

require_once ('snat_framework.php');

I am creating this framework to migate all of the websites I have developed to the same code base. This framework is in development and will be finished one day but you might find it useful. I am not expecting a single person to use it nor wanting to use it. This is purely for my own learning, organising and development. Don't expect this to work at this time, it will be a long while until then!

So I will say this once.

# DO NOT USE ON A PRODUCTION SERVER #
